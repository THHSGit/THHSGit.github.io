        <p>This is a simplified version of the Ephebic Oath which is recited by Freshman at Townsend Harris.</p>
      </div>
    <p>I will not bring dishonour on my sacred arms nor will I abandon my comrade wherever I shall be stationed. I will defend the rights of gods and men and will not leave my country smaller, when I die, but greater and better, so far as I am able by myself and with the help of all. I will respect the rulers of the time duly and the existing ordinances duly and all others which may be established in the future. Furthermore, if anyone seeks to destroy the ordinances I will oppose him so far as I am able by myself and with the help of all. I will honor the cults of my fathers. Witnesses to this shall be the gods Agraulus, Hestia, Enyo, Enyalius, Ares, Athena the Warrior, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone, Heracles, and the boundaries of my native land, wheat, barley, vines, olive-trees, fig-trees...<br>

      </div>
      <p><i>"I shall never bring disgrace to my city, nor shall I ever desert my comrades in the ranks; but I, both alone and with my many comrades, shall fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city. I shall willingly pay heed to whoever renders judgment with wisdom and shall obey both the laws already established and whatever laws the people in their wisdom shall establish. I, alone and with my comrades, shall resist anyone who destroys the laws or disobeys them. I shall not leave my city any less but rather greater than I found it."<br>
      -<i>The Ephebic Oath THHS Edition</i></i></p>
      <p>The Ephebic Oath is a declaration that was originally sworn by 18 year old sons of citizens of Classical Athens upon induction into the city’s military academy. Graduation from this academy was a prerequisite for obtaining citizenship in Athens. In it, young men swore to always be an asset to their city, and to leave it better, not worse, than they found it. They promise to never bring disgrace upon their city or their comrades, and to respect the rule of law in the city. It truly embodies the honorable warrior spirit that the ancient Greeks cherished, and emphasizes dignity, respect, and an unbreakable sense of community, all of which are necessary to the success of any large institution, be it a school or an empire. Today, in Townsend Harris High School incoming freshmen recite the Ephebic Oath like the young Athenian men used to do for their city. However, these freshman recite the Ephebic Oath to represent integration into the community of Townsend Harris High School students. By doing so, they accept the ideologies of the Ephebic Oath and what they have to do to fulfill it.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Ephebic Oath has a greater goal than what is portrayed in its text. It is not only about treating your friends and comrades as you would treat yourself, or leaving your community better than you found it. The Ephebic Oath is about setting up a good life and personality for someone by showing them what is the right thing to do so they can be better people in society. By doing this, they also act as a role model for other people, like young kids, so in the future these kids may also follow the footsteps of their role models. In the end, this creates strong bonds between people in a society and helps to develop the society and make it stronger.</p><br>

      <p id="p2">How the Ephebic Oath relates to Townsend Harris</p>
      <p>Townsend Harris was born on October 3, 1804 in the village of Sandy Hills. When he grew up he moved to New york City to become a merchant that imported goods from China. The most important detail of his life though was how he embraced the Ephebic Oath within himself. He devoted his life to serving his community and his country, and left his community much better than he found it. One of the ways he did this was by becoming the president of the New York City Board of Education from 1846 to 1848. In this time period he did his best to grant free education for almost anyone, and he want as far as opening a new school, Free Academy of the City of New York, to start his mission hoping it would cause a trickle effect as other schools joined the movement. In doing so, he would give everyone the opportunity to live better lives as they would have the knowledge to complete college and get a decent job. Additionally, from 1833 to 1856, Townsend Harris strived to increase trade between the United States of America and foreign nations like China and Japan. He did this by creating the Harris Treaty of 1856 (China) and the Harris Treaty of 1858 (Japan). His goal in this was to strengthen the economy and commerce in the United States of America.</p>

      <p>“Townsend Harris was an advocate for public schools, specifically for the working class. He truly lived the words of the Ephebic Oath, regarding leaving the community better than he found it. By educating the working class, rather than just those who could afford it, opened new opportunities for all Americans. Free education allows all Americans to live the American Dream and rise above the social/economic class they were born into.”<br>

      <p id="p3">Why the Ephebic Oath is recited at THHS</p>
      <p>One final and important question to ask is why we recite the Ephebic Oath at Townsend Harris High School. The Ephebic Oath has a particular significance to Townsend Harris High School. For one thing, our namesake, Townsend Harris, truly embodied and lived by its ideals. He devoted his life to serving his community and his country, and left his community much better than he found it. The main reason for this is to embrace the ideology of the founder of our school, our namesake, Townsend Harris. If he didn’t follow the Ephebic Oath and what it meant we would not be learning what we are learning today from the amazing teachers that teach us. Additionally, we would most likely not receive the opportunity to get high-quality free education limiting any future opportunities that we may come upon, be it scholarships for college or living the American Dream. Even the people who re-founded the school in 1984 followed the ideologies of Townsend Harris and the Ephebic Oath by providing free education for anyone in New York City. Therefore, we recite the Ephebic Oath every October as young little freshmen and incoming sophomores to embrace the ideologies of Townsend Harris and hopefully make his messages and movements stronger. It is like a thank you to Townsend Harris and everyone who helped him to found the school, and a statement that we will continue Townsend Harris’ beliefs and spread it throughout the world.</p><iframe height="480" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-ProE_hfo5bV93R1U3RTNNWDQ/preview" style="margin: auto;" width="640"></iframe>
