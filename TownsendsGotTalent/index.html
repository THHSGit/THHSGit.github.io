                Throughout Townsend Harris High School there are many young minds that excel in humanities, mathematics, languages, and countless other subjects. However, one department that is overlooked is the art department where the talent of many students lay. The students here at Townsend Harris High School pursue many interesting hobbies that have slowly evolved into a talent that only a few have. From instrumental talents to solving a Rubik's cube, here are some of the many talents that the community at Townsend Harris High School carries around with themselves every day.

                        In the Townsend's Got Talent act that is shown to the left, Townsend Harris High School teacher Mr. Dunbar plays the clarinet. Mr. Dunbar has been playing the clarinet since 4th grade and received his own clarinet in 10th grade. Despite being forced into playing the clarinet instead of playing the saxophone like he had dreamed to, Mr. Dunbar has risen beyond the talents of other clarinetists by playing for one of the highest levels of NYSSMA. He has continued to pursue this talent as he now plays songs for his son. His advice to future clarinetists is to practice and not to make squeaking sounds with your clarinet.

                        In the Townsend's Got Talent act that is shown to the right, a couple of members from <i>The Perfect Four</i> perform their cover of "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran, a famous English songwriter, and guitarist. Unfortunately, one of the singers could not make it while another one of the singers was not in the condition to perform. Both Amar and Andy have been playing the guitar for several years, along with Savannah playing the ukulele for several years as well. Andy and Savannah have been singing since Middle School. One of the most important pieces of advice from the band members was to practice every day, and to always learn new techniques that will aid in your performance.

            Throughout Townsend Harris High School there are many young minds that excel in humanities, mathematics, languages, and countless other subjects. However, one department that is overlooked is the art department where the talent of many students lay. The students here at Townsend Harris High School pursue many interesting hobbies that have slowly evolved into a talent that only a few have. From instrumental talents to solving a Rubik's cube, here are some of the many talents that the community at Townsend Harris High School carries around with themselves every day.

            In the Townsend's Got Talent act that is shown to the left, Townsend Harris High School teacher Mr. Dunbar plays the clarinet. Mr. Dunbar has been playing the clarinet since 4th grade and received his own clarinet in 10th grade. Despite being forced into playing the clarinet instead of playing the saxophone like he had dreamed to, Mr. Dunbar has risen beyond the talents of other clarinetists by playing for one of the highest levels of NYSSMA. He has continued to pursue this talent as he now plays songs for his son. His advice to future clarinetists is to practice and not to make squeaking sounds with your clarinet.

            In the Townsend's Got Talent act that is shown to the right, a couple of members from <i>The Perfect Four</i> perform their cover of "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran, a famous English songwriter, and guitarist. Unfortunately, one of the singers could not make it while another one of the singers was not in the condition to perform. Both Amar and Andy have been playing the guitar for several years, along with Savannah playing the ukulele for several years as well. Andy and Savannah have been singing since Middle School. One of the most important pieces of advice from the band members was to practice every day, and to always learn new techniques that will aid in your performance.
