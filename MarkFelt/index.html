                    <p>
                        As a lifelong FBI special agent, Mark Felt loved his country, and devoted his life to protecting it and its laws. However, his greatest, most heroic feat, came not as a G-man chasing down hardened criminals, but rather as Deputy Director of the FBI, violating
                        laws for the greater good-to take down a corrupt president.</br>
                        In June 1972, a group of burglars broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, hoping to steal documents that would help President Richard Nixon be reelected. The Nixon administration, and the President himself, conspired to obstruct
                        the FBI’s investigation into the break-in, to ensure that nobody would ever find out what they had done. However, Mark Felt continued to investigate, and determined that the administration was responsible for the break-in and cover
                        up. Not knowing where to turn, and certain that the Justice Department would not prosecute Nixon because they were protecting him, Felt began leaking information of the coverup to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, reporters who
                        published the revelations in the Washington Post. These leaks were in direct violation of the Espionage Act, putting Felt in danger of prosecution, but nevertheless, he persisted. Even under the threat of going to jail, Felt didn’t
                        crumble, exposing the corruption of the Nixon administration. His actions eventually lead to the prosecution of Nixon’s top aides, and the President’s resignation.</br>
                        Mark Felt is a true hero. He put himself in danger in order to do the right thing. He is a true modern day Antigone.
