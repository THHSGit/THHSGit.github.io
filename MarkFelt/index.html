            As a lifelong FBI special agent, Mark Felt loved his country, and devoted his life to protecting it and its
            laws. However, his greatest, most heroic feat, came not as a G-man chasing down hardened criminals, but
            rather as Deputy Director of the FBI, violating
            laws for the greater good-to take down a corrupt president.

        <h3>WaterGate Scandal</h3>
        <p>June 17, 1972 marks the beginning of a nationwide crisis. President Nixon wanted to make sure he was reelected and in order to secure his spot he sent 7 committee members to break into the Democratic National Committee’s Watergate headquarters and steal very important and to-secret documents while also bugging the office’s phones. However, they failed to bug the phones properly and on their mission to go fix and replace them, they were caught by a security guard who soon informed the police. The police traced the burglars back to Nixon but the people believed that Nixon was truly innocent and was reelected in November of 1972.

However, people soon came to crack down on Nixon’s lies. Two reporters from the Washington Post, Judge John J. Sirica, and members of the Senate investigating committee all planned to expose the truth from Nixon. Soon after, some of the people working for Nixon admitted to recording conversations in the Oval Office but Nixon continued to refuse to give up the tapes.

On October 20, 1973, the demand for the tapes did not end until Nixon the independent prosecutor asking for the tapes to be fired. This lead to other Justice Department officials resigning to protest Nixon’s decision. These series of events are referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre. In 1974, the whole story began to unfold and a new prosecutor was appointed. In July of that year, the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over all the tapes and he was eventually impeached for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, criminal cover-up, and violations of the constitution.

August 8 was the day when Nixon officially resigned after being found guilty. Some 6 weeks pass and Gerald Ford was elected as president and he convicted some of Nixon’s aids who were sent to federal prison while Nixon walked away free. The Watergate scandal highlights the distrust and dishonesty between the people and the government and why citizens are disappointed with the outcome of this country.

        <h3>Felt and his Heroism</h3>
        <p>
            In June 1972, a group of burglars broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, hoping
            to steal documents that would help President Richard Nixon be reelected. The Nixon administration, and the
            President himself, conspired to obstruct
            the FBI's investigation into the break-in, to ensure that nobody would ever find out what they had done.
            However, Mark Felt continued to investigate, and determined that the administration was responsible for the
            break-in and cover up.Not
            knowing where to turn, and certain that the Justice Department would not prosecute Nixon because they were
            protecting him, Felt began leaking information of the coverup to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, reporters
            who published the revelations
            in the Washington Post. These leaks were in direct violation of the Espionage Act, putting Felt in danger of
            prosecution, but nevertheless, he persisted. Even under the threat of going to jail, Felt didn't crumble,
            exposing the corruption
            of the Nixon administration. His actions eventually lead to the prosecution of Nixon's top aides, and the
            President's resignation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mark Felt is a true hero. He put himself in danger in order to do the right thing. He is a true modern day
            Antigone.
