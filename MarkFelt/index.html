                As a lifelong FBI special agent, Mark Felt loved his country, and devoted his life to protecting it and
                its
                laws. However, his greatest, most heroic feat, came not as a G-man chasing down hardened criminals, but
                rather as Deputy Director of the FBI, violating
                laws for the greater good-to take down a corrupt president.

            <h3>Younger Mark: Hero's are Made, Not Born</h3>
            <p>Mark Felt was born on August 17, 1913 in Twin Falls Idaho. He graduated from Twin Falls Senior High
                School in 1931, and soon after received a bachelor’s degree which propelled his will to work in the
                political field. Felt worked under U.S. senators James Pope and David Worth Clark, but followed to
                pursue a career in the Federal Trade Commision after receiving his law degree and 1940.
            </p>
            <p>
                Felt’s life took a major turn in 1941 as he began training to become an FBI Agent, and succeeded in
                doing so when he became an officer on January 26, 1942. Mark Felt worked under the Domestic Intelligence
                Division where he tracked down Axis Spies, and was promoted to the role of top undercover agent. After
                World War II, Hoover promoted Felt to Deputy Associate Director which was the 3rd highest position
                within the FBI, and under Nixon’s presidency Mark became the Post of Associate Director, the 2nd highest
                position in the FBI. However, Nixon would regret doing so soon after.

            <h3>WaterGate Scandal: The Problem Begins</h3>
            <p>
                June 17, 1972 marks the beginning of a nationwide crisis. President Nixon wanted to make sure he was
                reelected and in order to secure his spot he sent 7 committee members to break into the Democratic
                National
                Committee’s Watergate headquarters and steal very important and top-secret documents while also bugging
                the
                office’s phones. However, they failed to bug the phones properly and on their mission to go fix and
                replace
                them, they were caught by a security guard who soon informed the police. The police traced the burglars
                back
                to Nixon but the people believed that Nixon was truly innocent and was reelected in November of 1972.
            </p>
            <img src="images/THE_WATERGATE_Complex_image.jpg" style="float: right;" class="ui medium rounded image">
            <p>
                However, people soon came to crack down on Nixon’s lies. Two reporters from the Washington Post, special
                prosecutor Archibald Cox, and members of the Senate investigating committee all planned to expose the
                truth
                from Nixon. Soon after, some of the people working for Nixon admitted to recording conversations in the
                Oval
                Office but Nixon continued to refuse to give up the tapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                On October 20, 1973, the demand for the tapes did not end until Nixon ordered the independent prosecutor
                asking for the tapes to be fired. This lead to other Justice Department officials resigning to protest
                Nixon’s decision. These series of events are referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre. In 1974, the
                whole
                story began to unfold and a new prosecutor was appointed. In July of that year, the Supreme Court
                ordered
                Nixon to hand over all the tapes and his attempt to obstruct justice was uncovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned as President of the United States, following public backlash as a
                result
                of the crimes exposed by the tapes. Six weeks later, President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon for his
                crimes, a
                decision that is largely viewed as the reason for Ford’s loss to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential
                election. The Watergate affair highlighted the corruption of Washington politics and fomented distrust
                of
                the political class that may never go away.

            <h3>Felt and his Heroism: The Hero Fights Crime Behind His Cape</h3>
            <img src="images/C_a515KU0AEoyZ3.jpg" style="float: left;" class="ui medium rounded image">
            <p>
                In June 1972, a group of burglars broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee,
                hoping
                to steal documents that would help President Richard Nixon be reelected. The Nixon administration, and
                the
                President himself, conspired to obstruct
                the FBI's investigation into the break-in, to ensure that nobody would ever find out what they had done.
                However, Mark Felt continued to investigate, and determined that the administration was responsible for
                the
                break-in and cover up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not knowing where to turn, and certain that the Justice Department would not prosecute Nixon because
                they were
                protecting him, Felt began leaking information of the coverup to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein,
                reporters
                who published the revelations
                in the Washington Post. These leaks were in direct violation of the Espionage Act, putting Felt in
                danger of
                prosecution, but nevertheless, he persisted. Even under the threat of going to jail, Felt didn't
                crumble,
                exposing the corruption
                of the Nixon administration. His actions eventually lead to the prosecution of Nixon's top aides, and
                the
                President's resignation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark Felt is a true hero. He put himself in danger in order to do the right thing. He is a true modern
                day Antigone as he puts his own fate aside for the good of the people by doing something illegal 
                like Antigone did when she illegally buried her brother despite the consequence of death she faced.
