        <p class="titleText">Synopsis</p>
        <p>Disseus and his friends are really smart kids who always get 95% and above on their exams, projects, and homework in order to remain in their totalitarian society where high grades in school are a MUST as students with high grades compete to stay in the society. Towards the middle of the school year, a classmate named Clyde is assigned a group project with Disseus and a few of his friends. However Disseus and his friends always neglected Clyde and made fun of him. This made him really angry and caused him to do something that would severely affect Disseus and his friends. After a couple of days, Disseus and his friends noticed that all their grades have dropped significantly, even their group project with Clyde in ELA. This shook them as if this kept up they would be exiles to the society. They asked their teacher Mr. Athenus to look over their grade, and Mr. Athenus noticed that the grade was incorrect. In his grading book it said 60%, but he remembers giving them a 95%. Mr Athenus, Disseus, and Disseus’ friends determined that someone hacked their accounts to alter their grades, and eventually find out that it was someone at the headquarters of JupiterEd. Disseus and his friends venture to the headquarters to change their grades, but are faced with obstacles such as their consciousness being transferred to a computer to a battle against the hacker and his child towards the end.The hacker and child is none other than the CEO of JupiterEd, Mr. McPoison, and Clyde who wanted revenge on Disseus and his friends. In the end, Disseus defeats Mr. McPoison and Clyde in the digital realm, exposing the CEO, and restoring his grades back to normal to remain in the society at the expense of sacrificing his dear friends.</p>

        <p class="titleText">Characters</p>
        <p>Disseus (Dice-ius)- He is the powerful hero who restores his and his friends grades. He will fight through many tough challenges to reach his goal. He is like Odysseus in the Odyssey and his name is based off of Odysseus name, but also off of the first part “Disse” which is similar to dice, representing that his life in the society is being gambled on by the higher powers (with one of them being Mr. McPoison).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Clyde (Kl-i-d)- He is disrespected by Disseus and his friends who do not know that his father is part of the higher powers. Because of this, he will do his best to destroy the lives of Disseus and his friends to teach them a life long lesson. He is like the Cyclops in the Odyssey as Disseus will hurt Clyde by shaming him and making fun of him, just like Odysseus does to the Cyclops.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mr. Athenus (Ath-E-nus)- He guides Disseus and his friends on the right path to restoring their grades and reentering their society. He deeply cares for Disseus and his friends and does not want anything bad to happen to them. He is like Athena in the Odyssey as he will guide Disseus and his friends through many different challenges, like Athena does for Odysseus in the Odyssey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mr. McPoison (Mc-Poison)- He is the one who puts Disseus through the many challenges he will face to make it back into the society (home). He wants Disseus and his friends to suffer because of the pain that they have put on his son, Clyde. Mr. McPoison is similar to Poseidon in the Odyssey as he curses Disseus and his friends for hurting his son like Poseidon does in the Odyssey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Crena (Crew-na)- She will help Disseus through the many challenges he will face throughout the realm. She is like a crew member on Odysseus’ ship as her sole purpose is to help Disseus like the crew members help Odysseus.</p>

Clyde got an 80 for not contributing a lot. They all congratulate each other, but exclude Clyde. They decide to make fun of Clyde. Clyde goes home and tells his father about this which angers his father, and leads him to hack into Disseus’ and his friends grades and change them to 60s and below.

          <p>Disseus and his friends try to figure out what is going on with the overlying shadow of their parent’s wrath at their bad grades upon them.

With all this talk that they have their grades begin to drop even more for unknown reasons. Disseus and his friends begin to worry even more about their execution from society. Meanwhile, Disseus’ family is facing many problems with their reputation. Against the rules of their families, Disseus and his friends sneak over to Crena’s house to devise a plan to fix their grades. When they return to school on the next day they all notice a smug look on Clyde’s face.</p>

          <p>Disseus, Crena, and their friends head over to JupiterEd Headquarters. As Disseus and his friends enter the facility they gasp at how amazing it is.

          <p>Mr. McPoison reveals his true identity as the father of Clyde. Disseus begs him to let them go, but he plugs them into a huge digital server. They are transferred into the digital realm and find many obstacles facing them. When they enter the digital realm they are on a fast moving vessel heading toward a digital platform. On this platform is a monster who devours two of Disseus friends, but leaves him and Crena behind. While this happens, Mr. McPoison ejects the hard drive from the server and installs it into his laptop to be erased.</p>

          <p>Disseus and Crena fight through many different obstacles like digital demons and walking dead pixels that are trying to kill them. As they escape from this creatures, they notice the hard drive slowly being erased as the pixels begin to disappear from behind them. They frantically run towards the exit of the hard drive towards the connection port to the laptop. However, Crena is struck by a bolt of electricity and falls down, too weak to get back up. Crena tells Disseus to continue on his trek and do what they planned. Disseus leaves her behind, as she slowly gets erased from history.</p>

          <p>Disseus makes his way to the end of the hard drive and escapes into the processor. At the same time Mr. Athenus realizes that Disseus is almost done with changing his grades as he has been monitoring the fight using his weak connection to the JupiterEd server. He gets his grading book ready for this correction of grades. However, Disseus meets Mr. McPoison who is gladly waiting for Disseus. They have a final fight in Processor Hall where Disseus barely wins. Once Mr. McPoison is defeated, Disseus not only restores his grades, but the grades of his friends and any other who have been affected. He reprograms JupiterEd and makes it editable to teachers again. As he exits the processor, he is put back into the real world and runs back to his family to reunite with them and live a happy life from there on.</p>
