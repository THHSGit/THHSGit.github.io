                <p>The Ephebic Oath is a declaration, originally sworn by 18 year old sons of citizens of Classical Athens, upon induction into the city’s military academy. Graduation from this academy was a prerequisite for obtaining citizenship in Athens. In it, young men swear to always be an asset to their city, and to leave it better, not worse, than they found it. They promise to never bring disgrace upon their city or their comrades, and to respect the rule of law in the city. It truly embodies the honorable warrior spirit that the ancient Greeks cherished, and emphasizes dignity, respect, and an unbreakable sense of community, all of which are necessary to the success of any large institution, be it a school or an empire.</p>

                <p>The Ephebic Oath has a particular significance to Townsend Harris High School. For one thing, our namesake, Townsend Harris, truly embodied and lived by its ideals. He devoted his life to serving his community and his country, and left his community much better than he found it. According to Ms. Stillman, an English and History teacher at Townsend Harris High School, “Townsend Harris was an advocate for public schools, specifically for the working class. He truly lived the words of the Ephebic Oath, regarding leaving the community better than he found it. By educating the working class, rather than just those who could afford it, opened new opportunities for all Americans. Free education allows all Americans to live the American Dream and rise above the social/economic class they were born into.” The Ephebic Oath gives us a sense of pride in our school, because it is the same code by which our namesake lived. It makes us feel like we can belong to the great community of this school by following the Ephebic Oath, and makes us want to do whatever we can to make our community better.</p>
