                    Priscilla and Owen, recently married, are living their happily ever after.

                    Priscilla has been an aspiring actress for as long as she could remember. It’s not
                    surprising when her agent excitedly calls her, granting her a chance to star in the newest

                    scrambling to reconnect, to reunite, and to pull Priscilla out of the spotlight.
                    Owen passionately vows, “I'll always get Back to You."

                    After refusing to break up with his poor girlfriend Selena (Selena Cheung), valiant Justin
                    Lartes (Foram Patel) is forced to enter the 56th Selection Games- a suicide competition
                    where 8 brave men compete to win Princess Clara’s (Keith Yeung) hand in marriage. Despite
                    the appealing advantages that come with marrying the princess, Justin is not competing for
                    her, but for his freedom. He must go through a series of grueling obstacles including
                    fighting to the death to prove his etiquette, intelligence, leadership and strength. Losing
                    the games is not an option for Justin as it results in execution. All he wishes for is the
                    chance to run away with Selena. Will Justin survive the gruesome games and return to his
                    true love?
