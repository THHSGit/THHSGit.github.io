                <p>The Ephebic Oath is a declaration that was originally sworn by 18 year old sons of citizens of Classical Athens upon induction into the city’s military academy. Graduation from this academy was a prerequisite for obtaining citizenship in Athens. In it, young men swore to always be an asset to their city, and to leave it better, not worse, than they found it. They promise to never bring disgrace upon their city or their comrades, and to respect the rule of law in the city. It truly embodies the honorable warrior spirit that the ancient Greeks cherished, and emphasizes dignity, respect, and an unbreakable sense of community, all of which are necessary to the success of any large institution, be it a school or an empire. Today, in Townsend Harris High School incoming freshmen recite the Ephebic Oath like the young Athenian men used to do for their city. However, these freshman recite the Ephebic Oath to represent integration into the community of Townsend Harris High School students. By doing so, they accept the ideologies of the Ephebic Oath and what they have to do to fulfill it.</p>

                <p>In addition, the Ephebic Oath has a greater goal than what is portrayed in its text. It is not only about treating your friends and comrades as you would treat yourself, or leaving your community better than you found it. The Ephebic Oath is about setting up a good life and personality for someone by showing them what is the right thing to do so they can be better people in society. By doing this, they also act as a role model for other people, like young kids, so in the future these kids may also follow the footsteps of their role models. In the end, this creates strong bonds between people in a society and helps to develop the society and make it stronger.</p>

                <p>Townsend Harris was born on October 3, 1804 in the village of Sandy Hills. When he grew up he moved to New york City to become a merchant that imported goods from China. The most important detail of his life though was how he embraced the Ephebic Oath within himself. He devoted his life to serving his community and his country, and left his community much better than he found it. One of the ways he did this was by becoming the president of the New York City Board of Education from 1846 to 1848. In this time period he did his best to grant free education for almost anyone, and he want as far as opening a new school, Free Academy of the City of New York, to start his mission hoping it would cause a trickle effect as other schools joined the movement. In doing so, he would give everyone the opportunity to live better lives as they would have the knowledge to complete college and get a decent job. Additionally, from 1833 to 1856, Townsend Harris strived to increase trade between the United States of America and foreign nations like China and Japan. He did this by creating the Harris Treaty of 1856 (China) and the Harris Treaty of 1858 (Japan). His goal in this was to strengthen the economy and commerce in the United States of America.</p>

                <p>“Townsend Harris was an advocate for public schools, specifically for the working class. He truly lived the words of the Ephebic Oath, regarding leaving the community better than he found it. By educating the working class, rather than just those who could afford it, opened new opportunities for all Americans. Free education allows all Americans to live the American Dream and rise above the social/economic class they were born into.”<br>-Ms. Stillman (Writing Proccess amd APWH teacher at THHS)</p>
