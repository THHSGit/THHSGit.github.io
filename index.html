                <p>"I shall never bring disgrace to my city, nor shall I ever desert my comrades in the ranks; but I, both alone and with my many comrades, shall fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city. I shall willingly pay heed to whoever renders judgment with wisdom and shall obey both the laws already established and whatever laws the people in their wisdom shall establish. I, alone and with my comrades, shall resist anyone who destroys the laws or disobeys them. I shall not leave my city any less but rather greater than I found it." <br>-<i>The Ephebic Oath</i></p>

                <p>The Ephebic Oath is a declaration that was originally sworn by 18 year old sons of citizens of Classical Athens upon induction into the cityâ€™s military academy. Graduation from this academy was a prerequisite for obtaining citizenship in Athens. In it, young men swore to always be an asset to their city, and to leave it better, not worse, than they found it. They promise to never bring disgrace upon their city or their comrades, and to respect the rule of law in the city. It truly embodies the honorable warrior spirit that the ancient Greeks cherished, and emphasizes dignity, respect, and an unbreakable sense of community, all of which are necessary to the success of any large institution, be it a school or an empire. Today, in Townsend Harris High School incoming freshmen recite the Ephebic Oath like the young Athenian men used to do for their city. However, these freshman recite the Ephebic Oath to represent integration into the community of Townsend Harris High School students. By doing so, they accept the ideologies of the Ephebic Oath and what they have to do to fulfill it.
