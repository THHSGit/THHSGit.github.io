          <p>Disseus, Crena, Clyde, and a few other classmates have just finished their project. Mr. Athenus returns their project, and everyone but Clyde got a 95. Clyde got an 60 for not contributing a lot. They all congratulate each other, but exclude Clyde. They decide to make fun of him. Clyde goes home and tells his father about this, which angers his father, and leads him to hack into Disseus’ and his friends grades and change them to 60s and below. The next day, when Disseus and his friends log onto Jupiter they find out about these lower grades and are shock as they are scared of being exiled from society.</p>

          <p>Disseus and his friends try to figure out what is going on with their grades, but are distraced by parents making them sit home and study all day. Disseus and his friends frantically talk about their low grades throughout the halls and classes they share. With all this talk that they have their grades begin to drop, even more for unknown reasons, Disseus and his friends begin to worry even more about being exiled from society. Meanwhile, Disseus’ family is facing many problems with their reputation. Against the rules of their families, Disseus and his friends sneak over to Crena’s house to devise a plan to fix their grades. When they return to school on the next day they all notice a smug look on Clyde’s face.</p>

          <p>Disseus finds out from Mr. Athenus that he and his friends actually got a 95 on the project. Disseus goes to his friends and they find out what is going on. They head over to the principal, who reveals that he is the enemy of the CEO of JupiterEd, Mr. McPoison, and in fact his parted brother. With the permission and information that the principal gave to them, Disseus and his friends devise a new plan to head over to the headquarters of JupiterEd and change their grades by confronting Mr. McPosion.</p>

          <p>Disseus, Crena, and their friends head over to JupiterEd Headquarters. As Disseus and his friends enter the facility, they gasp at how amazing it is. They enter Mr. McPoison’s office to talk to him, but as soon as they sit down, electronic conscious transferring devices attach to them and begin transferring their consciousness to a computer.</p>

          <p>Mr. McPoison reveals his true identity as the father of Clyde. Disseus begs him to let them go, but he plugs them into a huge digital server. They are transferred into the digital realm and find many obstacles facing them. When they enter the digital realm, they are on a fast moving vessel heading toward a digital platform. On this platform is a monster who devours two of Disseus friends, but leaves him and Crena behind. While this happens, Mr. McPoison ejects the hard drive from the server and installs it into his laptop to be erased.</p>

          <p>Disseus, Crena, and their surviving frieds fight through many different obstacles like digital demons and walking dead pixels that are trying to kill them. As they escape from this creatures, they notice the hard drive slowly being erased as the pixels begin to disappear from behind them. They frantically run towards the exit of the hard drive towards the connection port to the laptop. However, Crena is hit by a dead pixel before it disappeared and falls down, too weak to get back up. Crena tells Disseus and his friends to continue on his trek and do what they planned. Disseus leaves her behind, as she slowly gets erased from history.</p>

          <p>Disseus makes his way to the end of the hard drive and escapes into the processor. At the same time Mr. Athenus realizes that Disseus is almost done with changing his grades as he has been monitoring the fight using his weak connection to the JupiterEd server. He gets his grading book ready for this correction of grades. However, Disseus meets Mr. McPoison who is gladly waiting for Disseus. They have a final fight in Processor Hall where Disseus barely wins. Once Mr. McPoison is defeated, Disseus not only restores his grades, but the grades of his surviving friends and any other who have been affected. He reprograms JupiterEd and makes it editable to teachers again. As he exits the processor, he is put back into the real world and runs back to his family to reunite with them and live a happy life from there on.</p>
