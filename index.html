                        Priscilla and Owen, recently married, are living their happily ever after.
                        Or that’s what they think.
                        Priscilla has been an aspiring actress for as long as she could remember. It’s not surprising when her agent excitedly calls her, granting her a chance to star in the newest Hollywood show. She jumps at the opportunity; however, her actions are too hasteful. A ditzy mix-up along with an impulsive decision splits two lovebirds miles apart leaving them scrambling to reconnect, to reunite, and to pull Priscilla out of the spotlight.
                        Owen passionately vows, “I'll always get Back to You."<p><br>

                        HE’S NOT THE FIRST, BUT HE MAY BE THE

                        LAST.

                        It’s the year 2075, where 0.17% of modernized America’s
                        population is clinically disabled. Enter a dystopian world

                        experimentation for the “greater good” is standard. Zoom in
                        a little further into the life of a crippled, and loved, husband
                        and father. #10 wakes up to find himself captured and in the
                        process of being tested on. Follow his journey as he tries to
                        get back home. Throw in an evil scientist, a secretly kind
                        accomplice, and a son who is ready to dig up some dirt, and

                        things get a lot more complicated.
                        He's not the first, but he may be the last.
